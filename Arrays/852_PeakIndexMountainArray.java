Topics - Array, Binary Search, Weekly Contest 89

You are given an integer mountain array arr of length n where the values increase to a peak element and then decrease.

Return the index of the peak element.

Your task is to solve it in O(log(n)) time complexity.

 
Example 1:
Input: arr = [0,1,0]
Output: 1

Example 2:
Input: arr = [0,2,1,0]
Output: 1

Example 3:
Input: arr = [0,10,5,2]
Output: 1

 
Constraints:
3 <= arr.length <= 10^5
0 <= arr[i] <= 10^6
arr is guaranteed to be a mountain array.*/



class Solution {
    public int peakIndexInMountainArray(int[] arr) {
        int start = 0;
        int end = arr.length - 1;
        while (start < end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            if (arr[mid] < arr[mid + 1]) {
                start = mid + 1;
            } else {
                end = mid;
            }
        }
        return start;
    }
}
